# ðŸ”¹ Interactive Card Details Form

An interactive card details form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where users can fill out their information and see the card details update in real time. The form includes validation to ensure all fields are correctly filled out: if any input is empty or the card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are incorrectly formatted, the user will receive an error message. With a responsive layout and interactive states like hover, active, and focus, the user experience is smooth and intuitive.

Because paying online should be as smooth as your credit card swiping experience.
